      <p>
        Follow these five steps for every prompt you submit. Each step must be completed
        for the prompt to be accepted.
      </p>

      <!-- 1. Choose a seed fact -->
      <section>
        <h3>1. Choose a Seed Fact</h3>
        <p>
          Start from a concrete, web‑verifiable “anchor” that your entire prompt will
          revolve around.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a specific person, event, artifact, or statistic as your seed.</li>
          <li>Good seeds: a well‑known scientist, a historical treaty, a famous artifact,
              or a numeric figure like a country’s GDP in a given year.</li>
          <li>The seed guarantees that the final question has a verifiable answer on the web.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- 2. Build 4+ reasoning layers -->
      <section>
        <h3>2. Build 4+ Reasoning Layers</h3>
        <p>
          Add at least four distinct clues that all need to be true for the final answer.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each layer should require its own search or reasoning step and help narrow
              down the correct answer.</li>
          <li>Avoid filler details that do not affect which answer is correct.</li>
        </ul>

            As of 2020, a researcher who completed a PhD in computer science at a
            university in Switzerland published a widely cited paper on adversarial
            attacks against image‑classification models trained on a dataset released
            in 2009. The paper was presented at a top‑tier machine‑learning conference
            held in North America, and one of the paper’s co‑authors later joined a
            large U.S. technology company’s AI research lab headquartered in California.
            What is the title of the 2016 paper by this researcher that analyzes defenses
            against these adversarial attacks?
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Layer 1: Researcher with a computer‑science PhD at a Swiss university.</li>
            <li>Layer 2: Focus on adversarial attacks on a dataset released in 2009.</li>
            <li>Layer 3: Paper presented at a top‑tier ML conference in North America.</li>
            <li>Layer 4: Co‑author later joins a large U.S. tech company’s AI research lab in California.</li>

      <!-- 3. Shape the ground-truth answer -->
      <section>
        <h3>3. Shape the Ground‑Truth Answer</h3>
        <p>
          Decide what exact string will count as the correct answer before you test the prompt.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the shortest distinctive string (e.g., <em>Lakers</em>, not a full sentence).</li>
          <li>Treat capitalization as irrelevant; the same string in any case is acceptable.</li>
          <li>Avoid time‑sensitive answers; choose facts that will remain stable over time.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- 4. Break-test in Gemini 2.5 -->
      <section>
        <h3>4. Break‑Test in Gemini Pro 2.5</h3>
        <p>
          Your prompt must fool Gemini three times in a row with Google Search grounding on.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open
            <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat?model=gemini-2.5-pro"
               target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              Gemini Pro 2.5
            </a>
            and ensure “Grounding with Google Search” is enabled.
          </li>
          <li>Paste your question and run it three times.</li>
          <li>If Gemini answers correctly more than once, increase difficulty by adding
              or tightening reasoning layers, then retest.</li>
          <li>When Gemini fails (or refuses) in all three runs, capture at least one clear
              screenshot showing the failed answer and that grounding is on.</li>
        </ol>

      <!-- 5. Add rubric and high-level plan -->
      <section>
        <h3>5. Add Rubric &amp; High‑Level Plan</h3>
        <p>
          Document how a careful solver could reach the answer using the web.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Write rubric lines that explain each reasoning step and include at least
              one citation per step.</li>
          <li>Draft a high‑level plan as a sequence of sub‑goals beginning with
              <strong>Verify</strong>, <strong>Find</strong>, or <strong>Cross‑reference</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

            Example prompt: An example of this “anti‑art” movement is a work consisting solely
            of a porcelain fixture, created sometime before the events of The Great Gatsby,
            but after the events of Red Dead Redemption 2. The artist’s second wife’s
            nickname is one of six adjectives in a song that was once #1 on the Billboard Hot
            100. The song prominently describes an article of clothing worn by the subject
            of Japanese sculpture. This Japanese sculpture was completed one year before
            its companion piece. What is the name of the art movement these Japanese
            sculptures belong to?
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Verify when the events of The Great Gatsby took place.</li>
            <li>Verify when the events of Red Dead Redemption 2 took place.</li>
            <li>Cross‑reference the allowed date range between those events.</li>
            <li>Find art movements active before that range.</li>
            <li>Find examples from that movement consisting solely of a porcelain fixture.</li>
            <li>Verify the artist who created the porcelain piece.</li>
            <li>Find the artist’s second wife and verify her nickname.</li>
            <li>Find #1 Billboard Hot 100 songs that include that nickname.</li>
            <li>Verify the song has six adjectives in the title and describes a clothing item.</li>
            <li>Find Japanese sculptures featuring that clothing item and confirm there is a companion piece.</li>
            <li>Verify the sculpture predates its companion by one year.</li>
            <li>Identify the art movement those sculptures belong to (final answer).</li>
