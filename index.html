      <h2>Project Overview &amp; Goal</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Project X! Your objective is to create a dataset that tests whether an LLM can solve difficult tasks that are hard to answer but easy to verify.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Goal: Create prompts that fool Gemini Pro 2.5 three out of three times while still being verifiable by a human.</li>
        <li>Each task should involve a challenging, fact‑seeking question with a single, indisputable answer supported by verifiable evidence.</li>
        <li>Answers must remain constant over time (for example, avoid time‑sensitive questions such as “Who won the World Series last year?”).</li>
        <li>All facts should be searchable on the web.</li>
        <li>Answers must be in a single answer, in simple form. For example: Dodgers.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="rules">
      <h2>Critical Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No AI tools while working.</li>
        <li>No plagiarism or copying. Each prompt must be unique.</li>
        <li>No step‑by‑step instruction prompts: Do not tell the model what to search in which order. The model must figure out the reasoning path on its own.</li>
      </ul>
