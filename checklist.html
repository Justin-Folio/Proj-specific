      <h2>Final Checklist</h2>
      <p>Use this checklist right before submitting any prompt to reduce QA rejections. Every item should be “yes.”</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The prompt uses at least four real reasoning layers, each contributing to narrowing down the answer, with supporting web sources.</li>
        <li>The question is complex but solvable by an expert with web search; it cannot be answered by a simple, direct Google query alone.</li>
        <li>The answer is string‑matchable, evergreen, unambiguous, and not easily guessable.</li>
        <li>No AI tools, plagiarism, counting tricks, non‑text sources, or step‑by‑step instructions are used.</li>
        <li>Gemini Pro 2.5 with Google grounding fails three out of three times, and you have at least one screenshot showing the failure and grounding on.</li>
        <li>Rubrics explain each reasoning step and include correct English‑language citations that can be accessed without extra clicks (no navigation‑heavy pages).</li>
        <li>The high‑level plan is a clean sequence of “Verify / Find / Cross‑reference” steps that, if followed, lead from the question to the final answer.</li>
        <li>The wording is professional, grammatical, and polished enough for a production‑quality dataset.</li>
      </ul>
