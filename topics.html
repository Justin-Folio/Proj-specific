    <h2>Choosing Topics &amp; Sources</h2>
    <p>
      Strong prompts start from stable, well‑documented facts. Use this guide to pick good “seed” topics and reliable sources that support multi‑step reasoning.
    </p>

    <h3>High‑Value Topic Areas</h3>
    <p>These domains usually have stable, multi‑verifiable facts that work well for complex prompts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Academic research:</strong> publication dates, author affiliations, citation counts, methods, and key results.</li>
      <li><strong>Science &amp; technology:</strong> discovery timelines, inventors, patent filings, product specifications, software release histories.</li>
      <li><strong>Health &amp; medicine:</strong> drug approval dates, device approvals, established procedures, historical outbreaks and treatments.</li>
      <li><strong>Business &amp; finance:</strong> company founding dates, IPO details, mergers and acquisitions, executive tenures.</li>
      <li><strong>Law &amp; government:</strong> court decisions, legislation dates, treaty signatures, terms of office.</li>
      <li><strong>Arts &amp; culture:</strong> artwork creation dates, museum holdings, publication histories, artist biographies.</li>
      <li><strong>History &amp; geography:</strong> battles, treaties, political boundary changes, city founding dates, landmark discoveries.</li>
      <li><strong>Sports &amp; records:</strong> game scores, championship results, world records, player career stats.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lower‑Value or Risky Areas</h3>
    <p>Use these with caution, or avoid them, because the facts change quickly or are too subjective:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Current news, live events, or rapidly evolving situations.</li>
      <li>Product reviews, restaurant ratings, trends, or other opinion‑based content.</li>
      <li>Highly dynamic tech or digital‑culture topics where details change frequently.</li>
      <li>Personal planning or advice questions that do not have a single factual answer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Suggested Source Types</h3>
    <p>Where possible, favor authoritative, reference‑style sites over blogs or wikis:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Research databases and journals (e.g., major publishers, open‑access repositories, institutional archives).</li>
      <li>Government and regulatory sites for law, policy, and medical or device approvals.</li>
      <li>University and museum sites for historical, biographical, and cultural information.</li>
      <li>Official statistics portals and financial filings for economic and corporate facts.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
      Wikipedia may be used, but it must make up no more than 50% of your sources for any given prompt. Always cross‑check key facts with at least one non‑Wikipedia source.
