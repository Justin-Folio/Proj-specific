      <h2>Prompt Examples: Good vs. Bad</h2>
      <p>These examples illustrate the target style and level of difficulty. Use them as inspiration, not templates to copy.</p>

      <h3>Good example: Movie prompt</h3>
      <p>
        What is the name of a movie released in the 1980s, with a runtime between 1h 35 and 1h 50,
        directed by someone born in British India in the 1940s who was once a comedy writer, where one
        of the writers later became an evangelical Christian before returning to acting at age 40?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It has multiple reasoning layers: release decade, runtime range, director’s birthplace and birth decade, director’s earlier career, and a life event of one of the writers.</li>
        <li>Each layer is web‑verifiable and narrows the search; an annotator or QA can confirm every clue using public sources.</li>
        <li>The final answer is a single film title, <em>White Mischief</em>, which can be used as a short, string‑matchable ground truth.</li>
        <li>The prompt does not tell the model how to search; it only states facts and asks for the movie name, so the model must plan its own reasoning path.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bad example: Step‑by‑step food‑truck prompt</h3>
      <p>
        Start by finding a list of food trucks in San Francisco, then narrow it to porchetta sandwiches.
        Eliminate all locations that are not near the Ferry Building. Find famous trucks whose founders
        have an MBA from a top‑15 U.S. business school, and whose father formerly owned a London textile
        business and invested in a 1990s video‑rental chain; whose spouse is a Senior Director at a
        San‑Francisco software company focused on digital marketing. There will only be one found like
        this with Pakistani and Indian heritage. Who is this?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It walks the model through the solution path (“start by… then… eliminate… find…”), which violates the rule against instructional or step‑by‑step prompts.</li>
        <li>Instead of expressing clues as facts inside the question, it gives explicit search instructions, so the model does not need to plan its own reasoning.</li>
      </ul>
